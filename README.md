# SpotList

A spotify playlist management utility (Backend)

The source code for backend functionality is held in this repository. 

You can find configuratation information within the 'cfg' folder.
The 'models' folder contains pyhton files used to extract and explain required details of objects used by our web app from the Spotify API.
The stand alone files (SpotList.py, playlist.py, user.py) are responsible for creating the routes used to enable communication between all components of the system.

In order to test the SpotList, a user must install a web server to host the website locally. Our choie was Caddy. Visit https://caddyserver.com/ for installation details. After installing and running caddy, use the specified url in the CaddyFile to begin hosting the website.
